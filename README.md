**Your world, your rules** 

Totalitarian is the most prestigious market for aspyring absolute rulers!


## WARNING!!!
This project is based on ***heavy* satire** and it's not by any mean a real market. All things showcased are **fake**, *non-existing* and *false*. Although this is a functioning website all actions performed on it don't have real consequences.

I'm not a security expert, so I advise to not put sensible information and data on the website.
